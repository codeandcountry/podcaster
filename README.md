Podcaster
=========

Podcaster is a simple admin for creating podcast feeds and publishing episodes to them.


TODO / Issues
-------------

* Not all valid fields are currently supported. Here are some we know of:
  - images at the episode level
  - itunes:duration, although enclosure length is available
  - managingEditor and webMaster at the feed level

* Add ability to set default values at the feed level that pre-populate fields when creating new episodes

* Add ability to upload episodes through admin rather than providing url **on branch audio-upload**

* Add ingest functionality to monitor folder for new files and import / publish

* More granular access control
